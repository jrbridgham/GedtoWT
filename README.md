# GedtoWT
Converts Gedcom files to Wikitree markup files.

Windows:

Download the GedtoWT.exe file to your computer.  Place it wherever it's convenient for you, on the Window's desktop, or somewhere where you can easily access it.  

To use it, just drag-and-drop a ged file onto GedtoWT's icon.  It creates one or more txt files (each corresponding to a person in the gedcom) containing Wikitree markup language.  The txt file(s) is placed in the same directory as the gedcom file.  Then upload your original gedcom to Wikitree as usual and let it do its thing.  Then edit the new profile on Wikitree.  Drag-and-drop the text from your new text file into the Wikitree "Edit Text" box, replacing all of the text that Wikitree had generated.  On Windows, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V are very useful shortcuts.  Then "preview" the results to ensure everything looks good.  Of course, you can still tweak the markup text to your own preferences.
